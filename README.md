# Binary Search Tree Implementation in Ruby

The given Ruby code implements a binary search tree (BST) data structure, consisting of classes `Node` and `Tree`. This implementation allows for the creation, modification, and traversal of a binary search tree.

The `Node` class represents a node in the binary search tree and has attributes for the left child, right child, and data value of the node. The `Tree`  class represents the binary search tree and has attributes for the root node and data (an array of unique sorted values) used to build the tree.

The `Tree` class provides methods to build a balanced binary search tree, insert new values into the tree, delete values from the tree, find values in the tree, traverse the tree in various orders (level order, preorder, inorder, and postorder), determine the height and depth of nodes, check if the tree is balanced, and rebalance the tree.

The driver script demonstrates the usage of the binary search tree by creating a new tree with random values, printing the tree structure, checking if the tree is balanced, and performing various traversals. It then inserts additional values into the tree, rebalances the tree, and performs the same operations again.

This binary search tree implementation allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of sorted data. It provides a foundation for performing search and traversal operations on the tree, making it a useful data structure for various applications.
